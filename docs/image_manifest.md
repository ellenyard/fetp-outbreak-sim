# Rivergate Image Manifest

## Style Guide
- Rural Southeast Asia-inspired fictional valley; avoid real country identifiers.
- Post-typhoon Rivergate setting: muddy ground, flood marks, scattered debris.
- Photo-realistic documentary style; natural light; mild film grain.
- Consistent humid atmosphere; soft haze in distance.
- Earth tones, wet browns, muted greens; avoid oversaturated colors.
- Camera feels like a field investigator or journalist; eye-level perspective.
- Avoid recognizable real faces; use indistinct or rear-view figures only when needed.
- No real logos/brands; use fictional municipal signage if visible.
- Keep signage minimal and legible only when required (documents/maps).
- Emphasize water exposure risks: standing water, damp soil, drainage channels.
- Show rural infrastructure: bamboo/concrete homes, ward halls, community wells.
- Subtle medical/public health cues: clipboards, gloves, sample containers.
- Maintain continuity in time: late October, overcast to soft sun after storm.
- Use consistent camera lens feel: 35–50mm equivalent for most scenes.

3. If your tool supports negative prompts, paste the **Negative/Avoid** field as-is.
4. Replace the existing placeholder SVGs with the generated images, keeping filenames identical.
5. For artifact images (maps, reports, logbooks), ensure text is minimal and fictional; avoid real logos.
6. Maintain consistent lighting and color palette across the full set for continuity.
