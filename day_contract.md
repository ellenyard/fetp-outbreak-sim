# Sidero Valley Simulation — Pedagogical Contract (Days 1–5)

## Day 1

### Required outputs
- Working case definition saved
- At least one hypothesis documented
- At least 2 hypothesis-generating interviews completed

### Optional actions
- Review clinic records for additional cases
- Describe cases by person/place/time

### What “good enough” looks like
- Case definition includes clinical + person + place + time elements (draft is fine)
- At least 1 plausible hypothesis stated (can be wrong)
- Interviews show purposeful questioning (not just 'tell me everything')

### What happens if missing
- You cannot advance: downstream steps depend on a case definition and an initial hypothesis.

## Day 2

### Required outputs
- Study design selected (case-control or cohort) with a sampling plan
- Questionnaire (XLSForm) uploaded and processed
- Simulated dataset generated and exported for analysis

### Optional actions
- Document data dictionary / variable list
- Note anticipated biases and how you will minimize them

### What “good enough” looks like
- Study design matches your hypothesis (even if imperfect)
- Questionnaire includes core exposure domains (animals, vector, vaccination, environment)
- Dataset exports successfully and has usable columns

### What happens if missing
- You cannot advance: Day 3 assumes you have a dataset to analyze.

## Day 3

### Required outputs
- Analysis completed outside the simulation and confirmed in-app
- Key results summarized (at least 2–3 sentences or bullets)

### Optional actions
- Upload analysis outputs (optional)
- Record key limitations

### What “good enough” looks like
- You can state the main exposure(s) associated with being a case (direction + rough magnitude)

### What happens if missing
- You cannot advance: Day 4 decisions should be guided by your analysis.

## Day 4

### Required outputs
- At least one lab order placed (with awareness of turnaround time)
- At least one environmental action recorded (inspection or vector-related evidence)
- Draft intervention ideas recorded (can be preliminary)

### Optional actions
- Order additional tests to rule out differential diagnoses
- Re-check case definition and line list for missed cases

### What “good enough” looks like
- You can explain what each sample/test is meant to confirm or rule out
- You can articulate a coherent 'triangulation' story (epi + lab/env)

### What happens if missing
- You cannot advance: Day 5 briefing requires some evidence trail and a draft plan.

## Day 5

### Required outputs
- Final diagnosis stated
- Recommendations submitted to MOH director

### Optional actions
- Risk communication plan
- Surveillance strengthening plan

### What “good enough” looks like
- Recommendations are feasible and aligned to the transmission route

### What happens if missing
- End-of-exercise outcome may be indeterminate.
