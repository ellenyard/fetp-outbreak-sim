# Day 5: Evaluation and Reporting

**Focus:** Evaluating intervention effectiveness and preparing comprehensive outbreak report.

## Situation Update
- Interventions deployed for 24-48 hours
- New case surveillance continues
- Community response to interventions
- Stakeholders requesting final report

## Your Tasks Today
1. **Evaluate intervention impact** - Assess outbreak trajectory changes
2. **Analyze final data** - Complete epidemiological analysis
3. **Document lessons learned** - Identify successes and challenges
4. **Prepare outbreak report** - Comprehensive documentation for stakeholders
5. **Develop recommendations** - Short and long-term prevention strategies
6. **Plan for sustainability** - Ensure continued surveillance and prevention

## Outbreak Report Components

**Executive Summary:**
- Outbreak description (what, when, where, who)
- Key findings and conclusions
- Intervention impact
- Recommendations

**Detailed Sections:**
1. Background and outbreak detection
2. Methods (case definition, case finding, study design)
3. Results (descriptive and analytical epidemiology)
4. Laboratory findings
5. Environmental investigation
6. Interventions implemented
7. Discussion and conclusions
8. Recommendations

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Epidemiological:** New case incidence, outbreak curve changes
- **Intervention coverage:** Vaccination rates, vector control reach
- **Laboratory:** Confirmation rates, testing timeliness
- **Operational:** Resource utilization, coordination effectiveness

## Recommendations for Future Prevention
- Strengthen routine JE vaccination
- Establish integrated surveillance (human-animal-environment)
- Improve early warning systems
- Enhance laboratory capacity
- Community preparedness and education
- Agricultural practices guidance
