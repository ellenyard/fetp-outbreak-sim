# Hypothesis Generation Guide: Japanese Encephalitis

## Framework for Hypothesis Development

Use the epidemiologic triad to structure your thinking:

### Agent (Pathogen)
- Japanese Encephalitis virus (Flavivirus)
- Other viral causes of encephalitis
- Bacterial meningitis/encephalitis
- Parasitic infections (e.g., cerebral malaria)
- Toxic exposures

### Host (Person Factors)
- **Age:** Children <15 years at highest risk
- **Vaccination status:** JE vaccination history
- **Immune status:** Previous infection, maternal antibodies
- **Nutritional status:** Malnutrition as risk modifier
- **Outdoor activities:** Time spent outdoors during vector-active hours
- **Housing:** Proximity to vector breeding sites

### Environment (Place/Exposure Factors)

**Vector Exposure:**
- Mosquito (Culex spp.) exposure
- Outdoor activities at dusk/dawn (peak vector activity)
- Proximity to vector breeding sites
- Lack of mosquito nets or protective measures

**Animal Reservoirs:**
- Pig farming (amplification host)
- Proximity to pig pens (<100 meters)
- Pig herd density in village
- Presence of wading birds (herons, egrets)
- Proximity to wetlands/bird habitats

**Environmental Factors:**
- Rice paddy agriculture (vector breeding)
- Distance from rice fields
- Standing water near homes
- Rainy season (increased vector populations)
- Wetlands and marshes

**Socioeconomic/Behavioral:**
- Outdoor occupation (farming)
- Housing quality (screens, closed structures)
- Time spent near animals
- Evening outdoor activities

## Example Hypotheses to Investigate

1. **Primary Hypothesis:** Children living within 100 meters of pig pens have higher risk of AES than those living farther away

2. **Vector Hypothesis:** Children who spend >2 hours outdoors during dusk/dawn hours have increased risk compared to those who stay indoors

3. **Vaccination Hypothesis:** Unvaccinated children have higher risk of AES than children who received JE vaccine

4. **Environmental Hypothesis:** Children from households within 500 meters of rice paddies have higher risk than those living farther from rice fields

5. **Protective Factor Hypothesis:** Consistent mosquito net use reduces risk of AES

## Variables to Collect for Hypothesis Testing

### Exposure Variables:
- Distance from pig pens (continuous, or <100m vs ≥100m)
- Number of pigs in household/neighborhood
- Distance from rice fields (continuous, or <500m vs ≥500m)
- Mosquito net use (always, sometimes, never)
- Time spent outdoors during dusk/dawn (hours)
- JE vaccination status (vaccinated, partially vaccinated, unvaccinated)
- Outdoor occupation (yes/no for children/household members)

### Potential Confounders:
- Age (continuous or categorical)
- Sex
- Village of residence
- Socioeconomic status
- Housing quality

## Study Design Considerations

**Case-Control Study:**
- Cases: Children meeting AES case definition
- Controls: Healthy children from same villages, matched by age and neighborhood
- Exposure assessment: Interview parents about pig exposure, vector exposure, environmental factors

**Cohort Study (if feasible):**
- Exposed: Children living near pig farms
- Unexposed: Children not living near pig farms
- Follow-up: Monitor for AES development

## One Health Considerations

Investigate across human-animal-environment interface:
- **Human surveillance:** AES case detection and investigation
- **Animal health:** Pig herd seroprevalence for JE virus
- **Vector surveillance:** Culex mosquito abundance, infection rates
- **Environmental:** Mapping of pig farms, rice paddies, wetlands
