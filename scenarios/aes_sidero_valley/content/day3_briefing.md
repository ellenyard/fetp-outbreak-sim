# Day 3: Analytical Epidemiology

**Focus:** Conducting analytical studies to identify risk factors and confirm hypotheses.

## Situation Update
- Preliminary laboratory results arriving
- Descriptive epidemiology shows clear patterns
- Environmental investigation data collected
- Community leaders requesting guidance on protective measures

## Your Tasks Today
1. **Analyze study data** - Calculate measures of association (OR, RR)
2. **Interpret laboratory results** - Confirm etiology with lab evidence
3. **Refine case definition** - Update based on clinical and lab findings
4. **Assess environmental data** - Correlate environmental findings with cases
5. **Review intervention options** - Identify evidence-based control measures
6. **Prepare preliminary report** - Document findings for health authorities

## Analytical Approach
Design and analyze case-control or cohort study to:
- Identify significant risk factors
- Quantify strength of associations
- Control for potential confounders
- Establish temporal relationships

## Laboratory Confirmation
Expected results:
- CSF analysis (pleocytosis patterns)
- JE IgM serology
- RT-PCR for JE virus
- Differential diagnostics

## Decision Point
Based on your findings, you'll need to recommend specific interventions to the District Health Office.
