**Focus:** Implementing evidence-based interventions and monitoring their effectiveness.

## Situation Update
- Outbreak etiology confirmed
- Risk factors clearly identified
- Resources mobilized for intervention
- Public and political pressure for action

## Your Tasks Today
1. **Design intervention strategy** - Select appropriate control measures
2. **Implement priority interventions** - Deploy resources effectively
3. **Communicate risk** - Develop public health messaging
4. **Coordinate response** - Work across sectors (health, agriculture, environment)
5. **Monitor intervention coverage** - Track implementation progress
6. **Assess early impact** - Look for signs of outbreak control

**Immediate (Emergency Response):**
- Mass vaccination campaign (JE vaccine for children <15 years)
- Vector control (larviciding, adulticiding)
- Public health education (bed nets, protective clothing)
- Enhanced surveillance

**Short-term (Weeks):**
- Environmental modification (reduce mosquito breeding sites)
- Animal health interventions (pig vaccination, pen relocation)
- Sustained vector surveillance
- Community engagement

**Long-term (Months-Years):**
- Routine childhood JE vaccination program
- Integrated vector management
- One Health surveillance system
- Agricultural practices modification

## Coordination
Successful control requires:
- District Health Office (case management, vaccination)
- Agriculture/Veterinary Services (animal surveillance, pig health)
- Environmental Health (vector control, sanitation)
- Community Leaders (communication, mobilization)
