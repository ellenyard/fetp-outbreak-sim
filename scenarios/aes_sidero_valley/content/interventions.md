# Intervention Recommendations: Japanese Encephalitis

## Evidence-Based Intervention Framework

### Immediate Interventions (Days 1-7)

**1. Emergency Vaccination Campaign**
- **Target:** All children 6 months to 15 years in affected villages
- **Vaccine:** JE vaccine (inactivated Vero cell-derived or live attenuated SA 14-14-2)
- **Strategy:** Ring vaccination around cases, expanding to high-risk areas
- **Goal:** ≥90% coverage in target population within 7 days
- **Monitoring:** Daily vaccination coverage tracking by village

**2. Vector Control - Immediate**
- **Larviciding:** Apply temephos or Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) to rice paddies, standing water
- **Adulticiding:** Space spraying with pyrethroids in affected villages (emergency measure)
- **Environmental:** Drain unnecessary standing water near homes
- **Target:** Focus on high-risk villages (Nalu, Kabwe) first

**3. Personal Protection Messaging**
- **Bed nets:** Distribute and promote use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs)
- **Protective clothing:** Long sleeves, long pants during dusk/dawn
- **Repellents:** Mosquito repellent use when outdoors
- **Behavior change:** Reduce outdoor activities during peak mosquito hours (dusk/dawn)

**4. Enhanced Surveillance**
- **Active case finding:** Daily hospital and clinic screening for AES
- **Community surveillance:** Train community health workers for case detection
- **Laboratory:** Expedite JE testing for all AES cases
- **Reporting:** Daily sitreps to health authorities

### Short-term Interventions (Weeks 2-4)

**5. Sustained Vector Control**
- **Integrated vector management:** Combine environmental, biological, and chemical methods
- **Environmental modification:**
  - Improve drainage around homes
  - Manage irrigation schedules in rice paddies
  - Remove container breeding sites
- **Biological control:** Introduce larvivorous fish in appropriate sites
- **Community participation:** Mobilize communities for source reduction

**6. Animal Health Interventions (One Health)**
- **Pig vaccination:** Vaccinate pigs against JE where available
- **Pig pen management:** Relocate pig pens ≥100 meters from human dwellings
- **Veterinary surveillance:** Monitor JE virus activity in pig populations
- **Wading bird management:** Reduce wading bird attractants near villages

**7. Health System Strengthening**
- **Clinical management:** Train healthcare workers on AES recognition and supportive care
- **Referral systems:** Ensure rapid referral of severe cases
- **Stock management:** Ensure supplies of supportive care medications
- **Laboratory capacity:** Strengthen JE diagnostic testing

**8. Risk Communication**
- **Community engagement:** Town hall meetings, community dialogues
- **Mass media:** Radio, posters, social media messaging
- **School-based:** Engage teachers and students in prevention
- **Targeted messaging:** Farmers, parents of young children

### Long-term Interventions (Months to Years)

**9. Routine Immunization Integration**
- **National program:** Integrate JE vaccine into routine childhood immunization
- **Schedule:** Follow WHO recommendations (typically 2 doses by age 2)
- **Coverage:** Achieve and maintain ≥90% coverage
- **Monitoring:** Track coverage through immunization information systems

**10. Sustainable Vector Control**
- **Environmental management:** Permanent drainage improvements
- **Agricultural practices:** Promote intermittent irrigation, alternate wetting/drying
- **Housing improvement:** Screening, improved construction
- **Long-lasting interventions:** LLINs (long-lasting insecticide-treated nets)

**11. One Health Surveillance System**
- **Integrated surveillance:** Monitor JE activity in humans, pigs, and mosquitoes
- **Early warning:** Establish triggers for enhanced prevention
- **Sentinel sites:** Designated human and animal surveillance sites
- **Data sharing:** Cross-sectoral data integration and analysis

**12. Community Capacity Building**
- **Health literacy:** Ongoing education about JE prevention
- **Community health workers:** Trained cadre for surveillance and education
- **Participatory approaches:** Community-led vector control initiatives

## Monitoring and Evaluation

**Process Indicators:**
- Vaccination coverage by village, age group
- Vector control activities completed (hectares treated, households sprayed)
- ITN distribution and use rates
- Healthcare worker training completion

**Outcome Indicators:**
- New AES case incidence by week
- Culex mosquito abundance (larval and adult indices)
- JE seroprevalence in pig herds
- Case fatality rate among AES cases

**Impact Indicators:**
- Overall AES incidence reduction (target: >80% reduction from baseline)
- Vaccine-preventable AES cases averted
- Outbreak duration
- Geographic spread limitation

## Prioritization Matrix

| Intervention | Impact | Feasibility | Timeline | Priority |
|-------------|---------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Emergency vaccination | Very High | High | Immediate | **Critical** |
| Bed net distribution | High | High | Immediate | **Critical** |
| Larviciding | Moderate | High | Immediate | High |
| Public messaging | High | Very High | Immediate | High |
| Pig pen relocation | Moderate | Low | Short-term | Moderate |
| Routine immunization | Very High | Moderate | Long-term | **Critical** |

## Resource Requirements

**Vaccination Campaign:**
- JE vaccine doses: 5,000 (assuming 2,500 children, 2 doses each)
- Cold chain: Vaccine carriers, ice packs
- Vaccinators: 10 teams (2 people per team) for 5 days
- Transport: Vehicles for mobile teams
- Monitoring: Tally sheets, registers

**Vector Control:**
- Larvicides: 50 kg temephos or Bti
- Adulticides: 20 L pyrethroid insecticide
- Sprayers: 10 backpack sprayers
- ITNs: 1,000 nets for high-risk households
- Personal protective equipment for spray teams

## Coordination Mechanisms

- **Outbreak Control Committee:** Daily coordination meetings
- **Sectors involved:** Health, Agriculture, Environment, Education, Communications
- **Community:** Village leaders, barangay councils, parent groups
- **External:** WHO, CDC, partner organizations as needed
