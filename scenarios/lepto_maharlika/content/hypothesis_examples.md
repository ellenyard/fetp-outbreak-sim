# Hypothesis Generation Guide: Leptospirosis

## Framework for Hypothesis Development

Use the epidemiologic triad to structure your thinking:

### Agent (Pathogen)
- Leptospira interrogans (multiple serovars)
- Other post-typhoon illnesses (dengue, typhoid, rickettsia)
- Waterborne diseases (cholera, hepatitis A)
- Vector-borne diseases (dengue, malaria)

### Host (Person Factors)
- **Age:** Adults vs children
- **Sex:** Males (occupational exposure) vs females
- **Occupation:** Cleanup workers, farmers, fishers
- **Immune status:** Previous leptospirosis exposure
- **Underlying conditions:** Diabetes, renal disease
- **Protective behaviors:** PPE use, hygiene practices
- **Health-seeking behavior:** Early treatment access

### Environment (Place/Exposure Factors)

**Water Contact:**
- Flood water exposure (wading, swimming)
- Cleanup work in flooded areas
- Duration of water contact (hours/days)
- Barefoot vs protected water contact
- Swimming in contaminated water sources
- Contact with standing flood pools

**Occupational Exposure:**
- Cleanup workers
- Farmers (especially rice field work)
- Fishers
- Debris handlers
- Infrastructure repair workers

**Environmental Contamination:**
- Contaminated water sources (wells, streams, flood pools)
- Damaged sanitation infrastructure (latrines, septic systems)
- Soil contamination
- Standing water persistence
- Rodent urine contamination

**Animal Reservoirs:**
- Rat populations (carrier animals)
- Livestock exposure (cattle, pigs, dogs)
- Animal carcass handling
- Contact with animal urine

**Behavioral/Protective Factors:**
- Barefoot activity in flood water (yes/no)
- Use of protective equipment (boots, gloves)
- Handwashing practices
- Chemoprophylaxis (doxycycline) use
- Wound coverage

## Example Hypotheses to Investigate

1. **Primary Hypothesis:** Adults who participated in barefoot flood cleanup work have higher risk of leptospirosis than those who did not participate in cleanup

2. **Dose-Response Hypothesis:** Risk of leptospirosis increases with duration of flood water contact (>4 hours vs <4 hours)

3. **Occupational Hypothesis:** Farmers and cleanup workers have higher risk than persons not engaged in these occupations

4. **Protective Factor Hypothesis:** Use of boots and gloves during flood water contact reduces risk of leptospirosis

5. **Geographic Hypothesis:** Persons from Barangay Malinao (most flooded area) have higher risk than those from less-flooded barangays

6. **Water Source Hypothesis:** Use of contaminated well water for drinking/washing increases risk compared to use of bottled/boiled water

7. **Environmental Hypothesis:** Living within 50 meters of standing flood pools increases risk

## Variables to Collect for Hypothesis Testing

### Exposure Variables:
- Flood cleanup participation (yes/no)
- Duration of flood water contact (hours)
- Barefoot water contact (yes/no)
- Protective equipment use (boots, gloves, none)
- Occupation (cleanup worker, farmer, fisher, other)
- Swimming/bathing in flood water (yes/no)
- Water source for drinking (well, bottled, boiled, untreated surface water)
- Proximity to standing flood pools (meters)
- Rat sightings in/around home (yes/no, number)
- Livestock contact (yes/no)

### Potential Confounders:
- Age (continuous or categorical)
- Sex
- Barangay of residence
- Socioeconomic status
- Pre-existing health conditions
- Chemoprophylaxis use

## Study Design Considerations

**Case-Control Study:**
- Cases: Persons meeting leptospirosis case definition
- Controls: Healthy persons from same barangays, matched by age and sex
- Exposure assessment: Interview about flood exposure, cleanup work, water contact, protective behaviors

**Cohort Study (if feasible):**
- Exposed: Cleanup workers with flood water contact
- Unexposed: Community members without cleanup work/flood exposure
- Follow-up: Monitor for leptospirosis development

## One Health Considerations

Investigate across human-animal-environment interface:
- **Human surveillance:** Leptospirosis case detection and investigation
- **Animal reservoirs:** Rodent trapping and Leptospira testing
- **Environmental sampling:** Water quality testing for Leptospira
- **Sanitation assessment:** Infrastructure damage, contamination sources

## Post-Disaster Context

Special considerations for Typhoon Odette outbreak:
- **Timing:** Incubation period 2-30 days (most 7-14 days) after exposure
- **Exposure intensity:** Catastrophic flooding creates massive exposure
- **Vulnerable populations:** Cleanup workers, displaced persons
- **Infrastructure damage:** Sanitation failure increases transmission
- **Intervention urgency:** Ongoing cleanup activities continue exposure risk
