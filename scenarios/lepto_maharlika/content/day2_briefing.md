# Day 2: Hypothesis Testing and Data Collection

**Focus:** Testing hypotheses through targeted investigations and environmental assessments.

## Situation Update
- Active case search identifying additional suspected cases
- Clear temporal relationship with post-typhoon flooding
- Geographic concentration in Malinao barangay confirmed
- Community members continue cleanup activities despite risks

## Your Tasks Today
1. **Test your hypotheses** - Design studies to investigate suspected risk factors
2. **Conduct environmental assessments** - Investigate water sources and flood exposure sites
3. **Interview cases and families** - Gather detailed exposure histories
4. **Collect environmental samples** - Water, soil, rodent specimens
5. **Assess sanitation conditions** - Evaluate post-typhoon water and sanitation status
6. **Expand active case finding** - Search neighboring barangays

## Investigation Priorities
- **Water contact exposure:** Flood cleanup work, wading through flood water
- **Occupational risks:** Farmers, cleanup workers, fishers, debris handlers
- **Environmental contamination:** Standing water, damaged latrines, rat populations
- **Protective behaviors:** Barefoot activity, lack of protective equipment
- **Water sources:** Contaminated wells, surface water use

## One Health Considerations
This outbreak requires investigation of:
- **Human health:** Clinical surveillance, occupational exposure assessment
- **Animal reservoirs:** Rodent populations, livestock exposure
- **Environmental health:** Water quality, sanitation infrastructure, flood pools
- **Disaster context:** Typhoon damage, displacement, emergency response gaps

## Clinical Spectrum
Watch for varying presentations:
- Mild: Fever, headache, myalgia (influenza-like illness)
- Moderate: Plus conjunctival suffusion, gastrointestinal symptoms
- Severe (Weil's disease): Jaundice, acute kidney injury, hemorrhage
