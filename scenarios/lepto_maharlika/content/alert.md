"Doc, we're seeing something strange. Since the typhoon two weeks ago, we've had multiple severe febrile illnesses—high fever, terrible headaches, muscle pain. Three patients have developed jaundice, and one is in kidney failure. Most are men who worked in the flood cleanup.

The hospital is overwhelmed and people are scared this might be typhoid or dengue hemorrhagic fever.

I need help here. This is beyond what we can handle."
