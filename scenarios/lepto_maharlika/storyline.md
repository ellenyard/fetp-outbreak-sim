# Leptospirosis Outbreak Investigation: The Waters of Barangay Malinao
## A Tabletop Exercise Narrative

---

## 1. SETTING & BACKSTORY

### The Place

The municipality of San Isidro sits in a wide river valley in the Cagayan province of the northern Philippines, where the foothills of the Cordillera Mountains slope down to meet the rice paddies of the Cagayan River basin. It is a place where carabao still pull wooden plows through flooded fields, where the smell of drying tobacco hangs in the air during harvest season, and where everyone knows whose grandfather feuded with whose over a property line fifty years ago.

The town center—a cluster of concrete buildings around a modest plaza with a Spanish-era church—serves as the commercial hub for the surrounding barangays. A district hospital, built in the 1980s and perpetually understaffed, handles everything from difficult births to motorcycle accidents to the steady stream of hypertension and diabetes cases that have become the province's quiet epidemic.

The four barangays that comprise rural San Isidro spread outward from the town center like fingers reaching toward the mountains: Malinao to the north, where the river bends and floods first; San Rafael to the east, perched slightly higher on ancient river terraces; Bagong Silang to the south, with its fishing community and stilt houses; and Santa Cruz to the west, where the land rises toward the forested foothills, serving as an evacuation site during the typhoon.

The people here are Ilocano, practical and hardworking, known throughout the Philippines for their frugality and resilience. They have weathered typhoons before—many times. This is what they tell themselves as the rains begin.

### The Disaster

Typhoon Odette was not supposed to hit Cagayan province directly. The forecasts showed it curving northward, grazing the coast before spinning out into the Philippine Sea. Instead, it stalled.

For three days—October 8th through 10th, 2024—the storm sat over the Cagayan Valley like a malevolent guest who refuses to leave. The rain fell in sheets, then in walls, then in what survivors would later describe as "water falling from a broken sky." The Cagayan River, already swollen from a wet September, rose six meters in thirty-six hours.

Barangay Malinao bore the worst of it. The river jumped its banks on the morning of October 9th, pouring through the community with little warning. Water reached the rooflines of single-story homes. Residents who couldn't reach higher ground climbed into the branches of mango trees, clinging there for hours as debris swirled below. The barangay's small livestock population—pigs, goats, a few cattle—panicked and scattered. Many drowned. Those that survived wandered through the floodwaters, bellowing, searching for dry ground that didn't exist.

In San Rafael, the flooding was moderate—affecting primarily the lower-lying commercial areas but limited by better construction and rapid drainage. Bagong Silang's stilt houses provided some protection, though communal wells were contaminated. Santa Cruz, in the foothills, escaped serious flooding entirely due to its elevation and served as an evacuation site, though access roads were damaged for several days.

By October 10th, the waters began to recede, leaving behind a landscape transformed. Thick brown mud coated everything. Dead animals lay bloated in the streets. The smell was overwhelming—a mix of decay, sewage, and the particular mustiness of flood-soaked homes. The government declared a state of calamity. Relief goods trickled in. Residents began the exhausting work of cleaning up, wading through standing water that lingered in low-lying areas until October 12th.

And then people started getting sick.

### The Emergence

The first patient arrived at San Isidro District Hospital on October 16th—six days after the flooding peaked. Renato Bautista, 42, a rice farmer from Malinao, came in with fever, severe headache, and muscle pain so intense he couldn't straighten his legs. Dr. Annalisa Reyes, the hospital's lone internist, initially suspected dengue, which had been circulating at low levels before the typhoon. She started supportive care and ordered the standard tests.

Three more patients arrived the next day, all from Malinao, all with similar symptoms. Then two more. By October 23rd, seventeen patients had been admitted with acute febrile illness, and Renato Bautista had developed jaundice and was struggling to breathe.

Dr. Reyes noticed the pattern first: almost all the patients were adult men, most were farmers or laborers, and all had been involved in flood cleanup activities. She raised the possibility of leptospirosis at the morning staff meeting on October 16th—she had seen a handful of cases earlier in her career, during a smaller flood five years ago. But the rural health unit physician, Dr. Carlos Mendoza, was skeptical. "We've never had a leptospirosis outbreak here," he said. "It's probably just viral fever. Everyone's immune systems are compromised from the stress."

Meanwhile, the cases kept coming. And on October 26th, Renato Bautista—the first patient, the rice farmer with the kind smile and the worried wife who hadn't left his bedside—died of respiratory failure complicated by kidney failure. He left behind three children, the youngest just eight years old.

As cases mounted, the provincial health office requested assistance from the Department of Health regional epidemiology team. Blood samples, collected on October 16th after a frantic scramble for test kits, were sent to the regional laboratory in Tuguegarao. The preliminary results came back on October 18th: three of seven samples positive for Leptospira IgM antibodies.

### The Call

The Field Epidemiology Training Program team receives notification on October 29th, 2024. Twenty-one days have passed since the typhoon made landfall. Thirty-four suspected cases have been identified across San Isidro municipality—twenty-eight of them from Barangay Malinao alone. Three patients have died. At least a dozen more are seriously ill with jaundice and kidney involvement.

The regional epidemiologist's voice on the phone is tense: "We need help. Cases are still coming in. The community is panicking. There's talk that the water supply is contaminated—people are buying bottled water they can't afford. The mayor is pressuring us to declare the outbreak over so it doesn't affect disaster relief funding. And honestly? We're not sure what's driving this. Everyone got flooded, but Malinao got hit hardest. Is it just exposure time? Water source? Something else?"

There are whispers in the community about other explanations. Some people blame the Chinese-owned mining company that operates in the mountains upstream from Malinao—maybe the floodwaters carried chemicals down from the mine tailings. Others suspect the pigs. A local faith healer has been doing brisk business, suggesting the illness is spiritual punishment for the community's sins. The local veterinarian has been asking uncomfortable questions about animal die-offs that no one in the health sector seems interested in answering.

The team's mission is clear: characterize the outbreak, identify risk factors, and recommend evidence-based interventions. But beneath the epidemiological puzzle lies something more human—a traumatized community struggling to recover from disaster, local politics and personalities complicating the response, and the weight of lives that hang on getting the answers right.

The helicopter lands at the provincial capital on October 30th, Day 1 of the investigation. The drive to San Isidro takes two hours on roads still damaged from the storm. The team arrives at dusk, greeted by a tired-looking health officer and the lingering smell of flood mud that permeates everything.

## 2. VILLAGES/COMMUNITIES

### Barangay Malinao (Population: 1,100)
**"Where the river bends"**

The most severely affected community, situated in the river's flood plain at a sharp bend where water naturally accumulates during high-water events. Primary livelihood is rice farming, with most families also raising small numbers of pigs and chickens for household consumption. Housing is predominantly single-story structures with bamboo and concrete construction. During the typhoon, 80% of homes were flooded to waist-level or higher for 48-72 hours. The barangay's water system—a communal deep well—was submerged for three days. Many residents waded through floodwaters barefoot during cleanup, often for 8-10 hours daily. The community reports significant rodent activity post-flood, with rats displaced from burrows appearing in unusual numbers around homes and food storage areas. 

**Attack rate: Highest.** Twenty-eight of thirty-four suspected cases reside here.

### Barangay San Rafael (Population: 2,500)
**"The commercial center"**

San Isidro's largest and most developed barangay, serving as a commercial and residential hub. Mixed economy of rice farming, small businesses, and pig farming. The community has better infrastructure than Malinao, including a partially functional municipal water system. Flooding was moderate (averaging 0.6m depth for 24-36 hours), affecting primarily the lower-lying commercial areas. Better construction standards and rapid drainage limited damage compared to Malinao. Several pig farms in this barangay reported sick animals post-typhoon—a critical clue for One Health investigation. Some residents participated in cleanup activities in Malinao, commuting daily to help relatives.

**Attack rate: Moderate.** Four suspected cases, primarily workers involved in flood cleanup.

### Barangay Bagong Silang (Population: 850)
**"The fishing community"**

A fishing and farming settlement along the river, characterized by traditional stilt houses that provide flood adaptation. The community has a mixed economy of fishing, rice farming, and small-scale agriculture. Flooding was moderate (0.8m depth for 24-36 hours), but the elevated stilt house construction and good natural drainage limited household damage. Most residents have experience with seasonal flooding and took preventive measures. Communal wells were contaminated but recovered quickly. Less intensive cleanup work was required compared to Malinao.

**Attack rate: Low.** Two suspected cases, both from the lower-lying areas near the riverbank.

### Barangay Santa Cruz (Population: 4,600)
**"The upland sanctuary"**

Located at higher elevation in the foothills, this is the largest and most prosperous barangay, home to government employees, teachers, and professionals. The barangay escaped serious flooding (minimal 0.1m depth for less than 12 hours) due to its elevation and served as an evacuation site during Typhoon Odette. Infrastructure includes spring-fed water systems with excellent quality (90% sanitation coverage) and well-maintained roads. Residents here did not participate in cleanup activities in the flooded barangays and had minimal exposure to contaminated floodwater. The community serves as an ideal control group for epidemiological investigation. However, Santa Cruz is located downstream from the Golden Valley Mining Corporation's copper-gold mining operation, and some community members have long suspected the company of contaminating local water sources. The post-typhoon illness outbreak has reignited these suspicions, even though no cases have been identified in Santa Cruz.

**Attack rate: Zero cases.** This community serves as the primary comparison/control group—but also as a source of the "mining contamination" red herring that investigators must rule out.

## 4. NPC ROSTER

### Healthcare Workers

#### 1. Dr. Annalisa Reyes, 38 — District Hospital Internist

The first to suspect leptospirosis, Dr. Reyes is exhausted but determined to be proven right. A Cagayan native who returned home after training in Manila, she carries a chip on her shoulder about being underestimated by urban colleagues. She speaks quickly, interrupts often, and has a habit of saying "I told them" about decisions that went wrong. Frustrated that her concerns were initially dismissed. Will be the team's best clinical ally—if they acknowledge her role in identifying the outbreak. 

**Relationship:** Key informant, hospital access.

#### 2. Dr. Carlos Mendoza, 55 — Rural Health Unit Physician

Twenty-eight years in San Isidro have made Dr. Mendoza comfortable, perhaps too comfortable. He oversees the municipal health system and initially dismissed the leptospirosis hypothesis as "overreaction." Now defensive about the delayed response and worried about his reputation. Speaks slowly and carefully, often deflecting blame to "limited resources" and "lack of support from the provincial level." Will provide data and access but may subtly obstruct if he feels the investigation reflects poorly on his unit. Has political connections to the mayor. 

**Relationship:** Gatekeeper, potential obstacle.

#### 3. Nurse Maricel Santos, 31 — Emergency Department Head Nurse

The organized center of chaos in the hospital. Maricel has been maintaining meticulous records of patient admissions, including exposure histories she collected out of personal curiosity. Soft-spoken but fiercely competent. She lost a cousin in Malinao to the flooding (not the outbreak) and takes the community's suffering personally. Will share her records freely and has observed patterns the doctors missed—but must be asked directly, as she won't volunteer information to people who don't seem interested. 

**Relationship:** Key informant, data source.

#### 4. Dr. Ernesto Villareal, 48 — Private Veterinarian

The only veterinarian in San Isidro municipality, Dr. Villareal serves the Santa Cruz dairy cooperative and treats livestock across the area. He is convinced the outbreak is connected to the cattle deaths he observed—and frustrated that no one in human health will listen. Animated and prone to lecturing about One Health, he will become a critical ally once the team demonstrates genuine interest in the animal health angle. Knows about unreported animal die-offs across multiple barangays. Has samples in his freezer he collected from dead pigs and cattle that could be tested. Must be unlocked by asking the right questions about animal health; will not approach the team unsolicited due to previous dismissals. 

**Relationship:** Unlockable expert, critical for One Health approach.

### Community Members

#### 5. Kapitana Gloria Ramos, 52 — Barangay Captain of Malinao

The elected leader of the hardest-hit community, Kapitana Gloria is a formidable woman who runs a small sari-sari store and knows every family in Malinao by name. She's angry—at the government for inadequate warning, at the response agencies for slow aid, and now at whoever or whatever is making her people sick. Protective of her community and suspicious of outsiders, she will test the team's intentions before opening doors. Once trust is established, she becomes an invaluable guide to Malinao's social geography and can facilitate community access. Knows which families have sick members who haven't sought care and has theories (not all correct) about what's happening. 

**Relationship:** Gatekeeper, community access.

#### 6. Mang Tonyo Bautista, 67 — Renato's Father

The grieving father of the outbreak's first fatality. A respected elder in Malinao who has farmed the same rice paddies for fifty years. His grief has turned to determined anger—he wants answers about what killed his son. Will share detailed information about Renato's activities during the cleanup period and can provide insight into the community's flood response. His cooperation legitimizes the investigation in the eyes of other community members. Speaks in Ilocano and broken English; an interpreter may be helpful but his meaning is always clear. 

**Relationship:** Key informant, community legitimizer.

#### 7. Luz Fernandez, 29 — Patient (Recovering)

A young mother from Malinao who developed leptospirosis but is recovering well. She worked alongside her husband in the cleanup efforts, often barefoot because her rubber boots were lost in the flood. Articulate and observant, she can describe in vivid detail what the cleanup work entailed—including details about water contact, wound exposure, and the dead animals encountered. Her husband, also a case, remains hospitalized in serious condition. She is worried, cooperative, and eager to understand what made them sick. 

**Relationship:** Patient informant, exposure history.

#### 8. Pastor Elijah Gonzales, 45 — Faith Healer

Not a medical figure, but Pastor Elijah runs a small evangelical church in Malinao and has been providing "spiritual healing" to flood victims who can't afford hospital care or distrust modern medicine. He believes the illness is partly spiritual in origin—punishment for the community's moral failings. His ministry is well-intentioned, and he has convinced some sick residents that prayer alone will cure them. He is not hostile to medicine but believes in complementary approaches. The team may need to engage with him respectfully to reach community members avoiding the hospital. Has information about unreported sick individuals. 

**Relationship:** Alternative healthcare provider, community influence.

### Officials and Other Stakeholders

#### 9. Mayor Roberto Villanueva, 58 — Municipal Mayor

A pragmatic politician facing re-election next year. Mayor Villanueva is caught between wanting to protect his constituents and wanting to project an image of successful disaster recovery. He has been pressuring Dr. Mendoza to downplay the outbreak severity, worried it will affect disaster relief funding and make his administration look incompetent. Smooth and polished in public, he becomes evasive when asked direct questions about response delays. Will provide official cooperation while subtly pushing for the investigation to conclude quickly with minimal political damage. 

**Relationship:** Political obstacle, official access.

#### 10. Engr. Ramon Santos, 41 — Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction Officer

The person responsible for coordinating the municipality's disaster response. Engineer Santos (everyone calls him "Engr. Ramon") has detailed data on flooding patterns, evacuation operations, and relief distribution. Overworked and under-resourced, he's been sleeping in his office since the typhoon. He has maps showing exact flood depth and duration by barangay that will be crucial for exposure assessment. Not a health expert but understands the connection between flooding and disease. Will be helpful if approached respectfully and not blamed for response failures. 

**Relationship:** Environmental data source.

#### 11. Mr. Chen Wei, 36 — Site Manager, Golden Valley Mining Corporation

The site manager of the mining company that operates in the mountains upstream from Malinao (4.7 km from the barangay). Mr. Chen has been fielding angry accusations from community members blaming mine runoff for the illness outbreak. He insists the mine's operations meet all environmental standards and has water quality test results to prove it. Defensive and corporate in demeanor, but not dishonest—the mine genuinely appears to be unrelated to the outbreak. His presence in the narrative serves as a red herring and a lesson about following evidence rather than assumptions. 

**Relationship:** Red herring, environmental data.

#### 12. Dr. Gemma Lacson, 42 — Provincial Epidemiologist

The regional epidemiologist who requested FETP assistance and will serve as the team's official supervisor. Based at the provincial capital (two hours away), she can't be present daily but is available by phone. Competent and supportive but stretched thin across multiple municipalities dealing with post-typhoon health issues. She provides legitimacy and can help cut through bureaucratic obstacles if needed. Expects a thorough investigation and actionable recommendations. 

**Relationship:** Supervisor, official support.

## 5. MYSTERY ELEMENTS

### Red Herrings

#### 1. The Mining Contamination Theory

Several community members are convinced that the Golden Valley Mining Corporation's copper-gold mining operation contaminated the floodwaters with heavy metals or chemicals. This theory is emotionally compelling—the community has long distrusted the foreign-owned mine—and seems to fit the post-flood timing. However, investigation will reveal: no cases have occurred in Santa Cruz (the upland barangay closest to the mine); water quality tests show no elevated heavy metals in flooded areas; and the clinical presentation is inconsistent with heavy metal poisoning. The team must respectfully investigate and rule out this theory while maintaining community trust.

#### 2. The Contaminated Water Supply

Initial suspicion falls on the Malinao communal well, which was submerged during the flood. Some team members or local health workers may focus investigation resources on water testing and water source analysis. While the well contamination is real and concerning, investigation will reveal that cases occurred among people who used multiple water sources, and the attack rate patterns don't correlate with well usage. The transmission route is actually direct contact with contaminated floodwater and soil during cleanup, not drinking water. This red herring teaches the importance of considering multiple transmission routes.

#### 3. The Dengue Diagnosis

The initial cases were treated as dengue fever, which is endemic to the region. Some health workers continue to insist that at least some cases are dengue rather than leptospirosis, pointing to similar symptom profiles and the presence of dengue in the area pre-typhoon. Investigation will reveal that while dengue coinfection may exist in some patients, the outbreak cluster timing, occupational pattern, and laboratory results clearly indicate leptospirosis as the primary etiology.

### Plot Twists

#### 1. The Hidden Livestock Deaths (Unlocked Through Veterinary Investigation)

When the team engages Dr. Villareal and applies a One Health approach, they discover an unreported die-off of livestock across Malinao and parts of San Rafael—particularly pigs showing clinical signs of leptospirosis. Farmers didn't report sick and dying pigs because they feared they would be forced to cull their remaining animals without compensation. Dr. Villareal has collected tissue samples from some of these animals and stored them in his clinic freezer. Laboratory testing of these samples will reveal Leptospira infection in the animal population, confirming a classic One Health outbreak pattern. This discovery dramatically strengthens the investigation's conclusions and intervention recommendations.

#### 2. The Barefoot Cleanup Detail (Human Behavior Risk Factor)

Investigation reveals that Malinao's community-organized cleanup crews worked in a specific pattern: men were assigned to "heavy work" clearing debris from flooded homes and rice paddies, while women primarily prepared food and cared for children on dry ground. Critically, the male cleanup workers often worked barefoot or in sandals—rubber boots were scarce, lost in the flood, or seen as impractical in the deep mud. Many had cuts and scrapes on their feet and legs that were continuously exposed to contaminated water. This gendered division of labor, combined with wound exposure, explains the striking male predominance of cases. Luz Fernandez, the female case, turns out to be an exception who worked alongside her husband in the cleanup rather than following the typical gender pattern.

### The Hook

The investigation is not just an epidemiological puzzle—it's a story about a community in trauma, about the ways human behavior during disaster response can inadvertently create new disasters, and about the invisible connections between human, animal, and environmental health. The team arrives in a community that has already suffered terribly and is now suffering again. The first death—Renato Bautista—was a beloved community member, and his father's grief gives the investigation emotional weight. The veterinarian who holds crucial information has been ignored and dismissed, teaching a lesson about interdisciplinary respect. The mayor's political pressure and the mining company accusations add real-world complexity that trainees will encounter in actual field investigations.

The mystery isn't just "what pathogen caused this outbreak?"—that's established by the time the team arrives. The mystery is: Why here? Why these people? What made Malinao so much worse than neighboring communities? And most importantly: What can be done to stop it from happening again?

The answers lie in the intersection of disaster, behavior, animals, and environment—a perfect teaching case for the One Health approach, wrapped in a human story that demands engagement.
