## WORKFLOW SUGGESTIONS

### Generation Priority Order

**Phase 1: Primary Characters (Generate First)**
1. Dr. Annalisa Reyes (medical protagonist)
2. Captain Gloria Ramos (community gatekeeper)
3. Mr. Anton Vale (emotional anchor, grieving father)
4. Dr. Ernesto Villareal (One Health critical path)
5. Nurse Maricel Holt (detailed data source)

**Phase 2: Supporting Medical/Official**
6. Dr. Carlos Mendoza (RHU bureaucrat)
7. Dr. Gemma Lacson (supervisor mentor)
8. Engr. Ramon Holt (disaster data officer)
9. Mayor Roberto Villanueva (political context)

**Phase 3: Community & Secondary**
10. Luz Fernandez (patient survivor perspective)
11. Pastor Elijah Gonzales (cultural broker)
12. Mr. Chen Wei (red herring character)

**Phase 4: Essential Locations**
- Hospital exterior and ward interior
- Northbend Ward hall and health center
- Flooding scenes (during and aftermath)
- Village streets (normal and disaster)

**Phase 5: Investigation & Atmospheric**
- Investigation team working
- Epidemiological curve
- Environmental sampling
- Faith healing session
- Community meetings

**Phase 6: Supporting Scenes & Details**
- All remaining location shots
- Atmospheric scene establishment
- Documentary evidence details
- Cultural context scenes

### Batch Processing Tips

**Efficient Batching in Midjourney:**
1. Group similar lighting conditions together
2. Batch all portraits in one session
3. Batch all outdoor disaster scenes together
4. Batch all indoor institutional scenes together
5. Save detail shots and documents for final batch

**Estimated Generation Time:**
- 12 NPC Portraits: 45-60 minutes
- 15 Primary Location/Scene shots: 45-60 minutes
- 15 Supporting Atmospheric shots: 45-60 minutes
- **Total: 2.5-3 hours** if batching efficiently

### Iteration Strategy

**If Initial Results Need Refinement:**
- Adjust specific physical descriptors for NPCs
- Fine-tune lighting directions
- Adjust emotional expressions
- Modify background elements for authenticity
- Ensure Filipino/Aruvian cultural markers are present

**Quality Control Checklist:**
- [ ] Filipino/Southeast Asian features authentic
- [ ] Appropriate cultural markers present
- [ ] Clothing appropriate to role and socioeconomic status
- [ ] Expressions match character personality
- [ ] Lighting appropriate to scene
- [ ] Background context supports narrative
- [ ] Documentary realistic style (not stock photo)
- [ ] Tropical climate visual indicators present

## NOTES FOR MIDJOURNEY USERS

1. **Test first with 2-3 portraits** to establish consistent style before generating all 12
2. **Use --seed parameter** to maintain consistency across related images
3. **Adjust prompts** based on initial results - Midjourney interpretation may vary
4. **Filipino features are critical** - emphasize "Filipino", "Southeast Asian", "authentic" in prompts
5. **Cultural authenticity matters** - include specific cultural markers mentioned
6. **Documentary realism** - avoid stock photo appearance, aim for photojournalism style
7. **85mm for portraits specifically** - this creates professional portrait compression

**Good luck with generation! These prompts are designed to create a cohesive, authentic, documentary-style visual narrative for the Rivergate leptospirosis outbreak training scenario.**
