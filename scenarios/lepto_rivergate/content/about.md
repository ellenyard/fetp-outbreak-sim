Rivergate Municipality sits in the Kantara River basin of northern Aruvia, spanning the town center and four surrounding wards (Northbend, East Terrace, Southshore, Highridge).
Recent typhoon flooding left standing water and widespread cleanup exposure across urban and peri-urban areas.
The local economy blends rice and corn farming, fishing, small businesses, and a major mining operation, with many households keeping pigs and water buffalo.
