# Day 3: Analytical Epidemiology

**Focus:** Conducting analytical studies to identify risk factors and confirm hypotheses.

## Situation Update
- Preliminary laboratory results arriving (MAT, ELISA, PCR)
- Descriptive epidemiology shows clear patterns
- Environmental investigation data collected
- Community members requesting guidance on safe cleanup practices

## Your Tasks Today
1. **Analyze study data** - Calculate measures of association (OR, RR)
2. **Interpret laboratory results** - Confirm leptospirosis diagnosis
3. **Refine case definition** - Update based on clinical and lab findings
4. **Assess environmental data** - Water quality, rodent burden, sanitation status
5. **Review intervention options** - Identify evidence-based control measures
6. **Prepare preliminary report** - Document findings for health authorities

## Analytical Approach
Design and analyze case-control or cohort study to:
- Identify significant risk factors (flood exposure, barefoot activity, occupational risks)
- Quantify strength of associations
- Assess dose-response relationships (duration of water contact)
- Evaluate protective factors (boots, gloves, prophylaxis)

## Laboratory Confirmation
Expected results:
- **MAT (Microscopic Agglutination Test):** Titer ≥1:400 or 4-fold rise
- **ELISA:** IgM antibodies to Leptospira
- **PCR:** Leptospira DNA in blood or urine
- **Culture:** Slow-growing, may not be positive for weeks

## Environmental Investigation
Key findings to assess:
- Water contamination (Leptospira presence)
- Rodent populations (reservoir assessment)
- Sanitation infrastructure damage
- Flood pool persistence

## Decision Point
Based on your findings, recommend immediate interventions to prevent additional cases while cleanup continues.
