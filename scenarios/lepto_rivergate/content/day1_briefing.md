# Day 1: Situation Assessment & Case Definition

**Focus:** Clean raw clinic data, define a working case definition, and triangulate early evidence.

## Situation Update
You've arrived at Rivergate District Hospital. Dr. Amina briefs you on the current situation:
- Multiple febrile patients with myalgia and jaundice following recent flooding
- Cases clustered around Northbend and riverside settlements
- Several severe cases admitted to ICU
- No definitive lab confirmation yet

## Your Tasks Today
1. **Abstract the clinic register** into a clean line list (structured fields).
2. **Review case cards** to recognize clinical patterns and variability.
3. **Build a tiered case definition** (suspected/probable/confirmed) with clinical, epi, lab, and time/place criteria.
4. **Conduct case finding** and complete the case-finding debrief (identify false positives/negatives).
5. **Complete the descriptive epi worksheet** (person–place–time observations and interpretations).
6. **Review the Day 1 lab mini-brief** and note limitations.
7. **Triangulate epi + clinical + lab evidence** and record working hypotheses for Day 2.

## Key Questions to Answer
- Which clinical features best distinguish leptospirosis from other post-flood illnesses?
- Where are cases clustering geographically?
- How does the timing relate to flood exposure?
- What evidence supports or weakens your working hypotheses?
- What critical data do you still need tomorrow?

## Epidemiological Context
- **Setting:** Flood-affected urban and peri-urban Rivergate
- **Population:** Cleanup workers, farmers, and riverside communities
- **Season:** Post-typhoon (August)
- **Previous outbreaks:** Sporadic leptospirosis after flooding events
