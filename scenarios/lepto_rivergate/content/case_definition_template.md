# Case Definition Template: Leptospirosis

## WHO Standard Case Definition

### Suspected Case
A person with acute onset of fever (≥38°C) AND headache, myalgia (muscle pain), or conjunctival suffusion

**WITH**

An epidemiological link:
- Contact with contaminated water or soil (flooding, wading, swimming)
- Contact with animals or animal urine
- Occupational exposure (farming, veterinary work, sewer work)
- Exposure within 30 days before illness onset

### Probable Case
A suspected case PLUS one or more of the following:
- Conjunctival suffusion (redness without discharge)
- Jaundice
- Oliguria (decreased urine output)
- Hemorrhagic manifestations
- Aseptic meningitis (CSF pleocytosis with negative bacterial culture)
- Acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine)
- Pulmonary hemorrhage

### Confirmed Case
A probable or suspected case with laboratory confirmation:
- **MAT (Microscopic Agglutination Test):** Single titer ≥1:400 OR 4-fold rise between acute and convalescent specimens
- **ELISA:** IgM antibodies to Leptospira
- **PCR:** Leptospira DNA detected in blood, urine, or CSF
- **Culture:** Leptospira isolated from clinical specimen (blood, CSF, urine)
- **Immunohistochemistry:** Leptospira detected in tissue

## Clinical Spectrum

### Mild Form (90% of cases)
- Fever, headache, myalgia (especially calves)
- Self-limited, 2-7 days
- Often mistaken for influenza or dengue

### Severe Form - Weil's Disease (5-10% of cases)
- **Jaundice:** Hepatic involvement
- **Acute kidney injury:** Oliguria, elevated creatinine
- **Hemorrhage:** Pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or other sites
- **Cardiovascular:** Myocarditis, arrhythmias
- **Case fatality rate:** 5-15%

## Exclusions
Cases with alternative confirmed diagnoses:
- Dengue fever (confirmed by NS1, IgM, or PCR)
- Malaria (confirmed by blood smear or RDT)
- Typhoid fever (confirmed by culture)
- Viral hepatitis (confirmed by serology)
- Hantavirus infection

## Post-Disaster Context
In post-flood/typhoon settings, maintain high index of suspicion for leptospirosis among:
- Cleanup workers with barefoot flood water exposure
- Persons with prolonged flood water contact
- Farmers and agricultural workers
- Cases presenting 3-30 days after flooding

## Adapted Case Definition for This Outbreak
*You may adapt this definition based on post-Typhoon Halcyon context, local epidemiology, clinical patterns, and laboratory capacity*
