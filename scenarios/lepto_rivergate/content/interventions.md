# Intervention Recommendations: Leptospirosis (Post-Disaster)

## Evidence-Based Intervention Framework

### Immediate Interventions (Days 1-7)

**1. Chemoprophylaxis for High-Risk Groups**
- **Target:** Active cleanup workers, farmers working in flooded fields

- **Duration:** Throughout exposure period + 1 week after last exposure
- **Alternative:** Azithromycin 250 mg weekly (if doxycycline contraindicated)
- **Contraindications:** Pregnant women, children <8 years (use azithromycin)
- **Distribution:** Establish distribution points at cleanup work sites
- **Coverage goal:** ≥80% of eligible high-risk workers within 48 hours

**2. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Distribution**
- **Boots:** Waterproof boots for all cleanup workers
- **Gloves:** Waterproof gloves for debris handling
- **Protective clothing:** Long pants, long sleeves
- **Priority:** Cleanup workers, farmers, infrastructure repair teams
- **Distribution:** Work site distribution points
- **Training:** Proper use, maintenance, limitations

**3. Water Safety Interventions**
- **Public advisories:**
  - Boil all drinking water
  - Avoid contact with standing flood pools
  - No swimming/bathing in contaminated water
  - Cover open wounds before water contact
- **Alternative water sources:** Distribute bottled water if feasible
- **Chlorination:** Provide water purification tablets
- **Well protection:** Chlorinate and seal contaminated wells

**4. Enhanced Surveillance and Case Management**
- **Active case finding:** Daily clinic/hospital screening for febrile illness
- **Early diagnosis:** Rapid leptospirosis testing (RDT, ELISA)
- **Early treatment:** Empiric antibiotics for suspected cases
  - Mild cases: Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID × 7 days

  - PPE stockpiles (boots, gloves)
  - Rapid diagnostic tests
  - Treatment supplies
- **Rapid response teams:** Trained teams ready for deployment
- **Standard operating procedures:** Pre-developed response protocols

**13. Community Health Worker Training**
- **Recognition:** Train CHWs to recognize leptospirosis symptoms
- **Prevention messaging:** Equip CHWs with prevention materials
- **Referral:** Early referral of suspected cases
- **Surveillance:** CHWs as surveillance sentinels

**14. One Health Surveillance**
- **Integrated surveillance:** Monitor human cases, rodent populations, environmental contamination
- **Animal surveillance:** Rodent trapping and Leptospira testing
- **Environmental surveillance:** Water testing for Leptospira
- **Data integration:** Cross-sectoral data sharing and analysis
- **Risk mapping:** Identify high-risk areas for targeted interventions

## Monitoring and Evaluation

**Process Indicators:**
- Chemoprophylaxis coverage among cleanup workers (target: ≥80%)
- PPE distribution and use rates (target: ≥90% of workers)
- Water advisory compliance (household surveys)
- Healthcare worker training completion (target: 100%)
- Rodent control activities (traps deployed, rodenticides placed)

**Outcome Indicators:**
- New leptospirosis case incidence by week
- Attack rate by exposure group (cleanup workers vs. non-workers)
- Early treatment rates (% treated within 48 hours of symptom onset)
- Water quality improvements (% samples negative for Leptospira)
- Rodent population reduction (trap success decline)

**Impact Indicators:**
- Overall leptospirosis incidence reduction
- Case fatality rate (target: <5%)
- Severe disease rate (Weil's disease %)
- Outbreak duration
- Secondary cases prevented (among workers using PPE/prophylaxis vs. not)

  - Communications: Public messaging
- **Community:** Ward leaders, cleanup supervisors, community organizations
- **External:** WHO, PAHO, IFRC, partner NGOs

## Special Considerations for Post-Disaster Context

**Ongoing Risk:**
- Cleanup activities continue = ongoing exposure
- Infrastructure damage persists = sustained contamination
- Resource limitations = prioritization critical

**Vulnerable Populations:**
- Displaced persons in evacuation centers
- Cleanup workers (often volunteers, poor)
- Children playing in flood pools
- Pregnant women (no doxycycline - need azithromycin)

**Equity:**
- Ensure equitable access to prophylaxis, PPE (not just official workers)
- Include informal workers (scavengers, etc.)
- Gender considerations (women may have different exposure patterns)

**Communication Challenges:**
- Competing disaster response priorities
- Misinformation about disease
- Fatigue with health messaging
- Need for culturally appropriate, clear messages
