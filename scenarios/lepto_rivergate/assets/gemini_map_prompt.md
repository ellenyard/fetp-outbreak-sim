# Gemini Prompt: Rivergate Day 1 Map

Create a stylized top-down map for a tabletop outbreak investigation game set in Rivergate, Kantara Province, Aruvia after Typhoon Halcyon. The map should function as the Day-1 interface.

Style: clean, readable, semi-realistic map art with subtle topography; soft muted colors; clear labeled icons for key locations.

Scale/Scope: include the town center plus four wards radiating outward: Northbend (north, at a river bend), East Terrace (east), Southshore (south, along river), Highridge (west/upland). Draw a main river curving by Northbend. Show upland foothills to the west.

Town Center POIs (cluster near plaza):

District Hospital (icon: hospital)

District Health Office / RHU (icon: clinic/office)

Municipal Hall (Mayor’s office)

DRRM Office (disaster management)

Town Plaza + historic church

Ward Northbend POIs (highest priority):

Ward Hall (Captain Gloria Ramos)

Riverside Hamlet (residential cluster; label)

River bend access point

Standing floodwater pool

Irrigation canal

Drainage canal (rat activity)

Granary area (rat infestation)

Rice paddies/flooded field

Pig pen area

Community wells

Cleanup debris pile (dead animals)

East Terrace POIs:

Market drainage area

Municipal water system

Private well

River access point

Southshore POIs:

Fishing dock

Communal well

Highridge POIs (control area):

Evacuation site / Ward hall

Protected spring / municipal water

Upstream Red Herring:

Golden Valley Mining Corporation (upstream from Northbend; include as a labeled site but visually “off to the mountains”)

Legend:

Interview sites (NPC icon)

Environmental observation sites (water/soil/animal icons)

Health system sites (hospital/clinic icons)

Government/admin sites

Add a subtle label: “Day 1: Initial Investigation.”
The map should feel like a real place post-typhoon (muddy floodplain, receding water, debris patches) while staying readable for gameplay.
